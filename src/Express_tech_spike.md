# Express.js Tech Spike

## What is Express.js?

Express.js is a web framework for Node.js. It provides a simple API for building web applications and APIs.

## Why Express.js?

Express.js is a popular choice for building web applications and APIs because it is easy to use and has a large ecosystem of plugins and middleware.

## How does Express.js work?

Express.js is built on top of Node.js, so it uses the same event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. It also uses the same callback-based API as Node.js, so it is easy to integrate with existing Node.js code.

## How do I use Express.js?

To use Express.js, you first need to install it using npm:

```bash

npm install express

```

Then, you can create an Express.js application by calling the express() function:

```javascript

const express = require('express');

const app = express();

```

You can then define routes for your application:

```javascript

app.get('/', (req, res) => {

  res.send('Hello World!');

});

```

Finally, you can start your application by calling the listen() function:

```javascript

app.listen(3000, () => {

  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!');

});

```

## What are the limitations of Express.js?

Express.js is not suitable for building large-scale applications because it does not provide any built-in support for scaling. It also does not provide any built-in support for authentication or authorization, so you will need to use a third-party library for this.

## Questions

* How should the API handle errors and validation?
* What authentication and authorization mechanisms will be used to secure the API?
